- Senior SWE at an IoT startup in DC called [signalframe](https://signalframe.com)

My background:
- Been in the industry for around a decade
- Mostly Java/C# until ~ 2014, then 50% Go, then ~ 2016 became full-time Go
- I spent 18 months as a machine learning engineer (mostly Scala/Go)
- A couple of years ago I started developing mobile SDKs full-time (mostly Kotlin/Swift) with some accompanying Go services
- I tend to use Go, Rust, JS, and C++ for hobby stuff. I like languages and PLT!
